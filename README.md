## Project Description

This project aims to create an application that offers language learning
services with online teachers. The application consists of three main pages:

1. **Home Page:** This page showcases the company's advantages and features a
   call-to-action button to start using the application, redirecting users to
   the "Teachers" page. The styling is implemented using examples provided in
   the design layout with various color palettes or via a prototype, which
   enhances the uniqueness of the project.

2. **Teachers Page:** The Teachers page displays a list of available teachers.
   Users can filter the teachers based on the language they teach, their
   students' proficiency levels, the students they work with, and the hourly
   session rates.

3. **Favorites Page:** This private page contains a list of teachers marked as
   favorites by the user.

## Key Technologies
